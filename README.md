# Google-Analytics (World Cup)
<em><b> Capstone project for Google Analytics </b></em>

For this capstone project, I used the dataset found on kaggle on World Cup from the year 1930 - 2014 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abecklas/fifa-world-cup).

Using MYSQL to do data cleansing and data transformation for it to be viable as to showcase as a visualization via PowerBI.

The project has sentimental meaning to me, as the first ever World Cup I managed to watch live in person was the 2014 World Cup which is why I selected up to 2014 instead of the available World Cup dataset that covers the latest 2018.
